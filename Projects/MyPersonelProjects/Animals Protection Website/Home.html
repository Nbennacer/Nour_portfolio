	<p>Human population had incredibly expended in the last century and still expending more
	and more faster. As human population increase, people use more lands, and this is means 
	less lands for animals. The world of Animal is decreasing as the same speed as human
	population increases. However, there are many factors that made thousands of animals 
	species extinct and there are mainly coming from humans. For example, when there is a war 
	somewhere, we always think about human lost, but we never think about animals lost. Also,
	while building in new lands as human, we never think about how many animals shelter we are
	destroying. When building new roads, we don’t even think that it is necessary to make barriers
	to do not allow animals to get into the road and get killed by cars. In brief, as human, we 
	caused and we are causing the extinction of thousands of animals and if we don’t do anything 
	to stop it, one day we human will pay the expensive price.</p>

	Unfortunately, it looks like the development that we human are working on to make our life 
	easier is what is taking us to our lost. All the dioxide of carbon coming from factories 
	or cars, and all the poisoned gazes that we are throwing to the air is causing an increasing 
	in the temperature of earth. The Poles Nord and South are losing their area and with that 
	the polar animal are in danger of extinction.

	The increasing of the temperature of earth is followed by an increasing of the temperature 
	of ocean. As a result, reefs are dying because they are losing their food which the macroscopics
	organisms that died from the hut temperature of water. The lost of reefs also cause food scarcity
	of the small fish which cause food scarcity to the bigger fish. In brief, all the chain animal
	is conserved by small increasing of temperature
